## Professor Information
*I did all of the original challenge criteria and didn't miss any of its points.*

1. Visual Change: 

- I added two new sprites for the visual change: one is a barking dog south of the spawn location in level one, and the other is the quest-giving NPC Cyrus, aka the witch located in level 2. Both of these characters have idle animations, and Cyrus' quest is mandatory for completing the game.

2. Audio Change:

- I added three new audio cues: one for speaking with Jambi (ribbiting), one for speaking with Cyrus (a twinkling sound â€“ akin to a star), and finally, one for picking up cog bundles for ammo (a short metallic hitting sound). Cyrus and Jambi's sounds can be heard when speaking to them (pressing X when in close proximity), and the cog sound can be heard when you pick up a bundle of ammo.

3. Gameplay change:

- My first change came with Cyrus; after completing level one and speaking to Jambi, you are transported to level two. The player now understands how to fix the robots, so Cyrus' mission is to find the apples they dropped after the robots got loose. This is as simple as running over the apples to collect them.
- My second chance came in stage 1, where if you explore the map enough (aka located below the south westernmost house, there is a banana. Similar to Cyrus' fruit, you can just run over to collect it, but when you do, it increases your speed, allowing you to move faster.
